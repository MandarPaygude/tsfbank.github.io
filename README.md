Hello there! I have created a simple banking website. Customers having accounts in this bank can easily make their secure transactions with other account holders of the same bank.

The website have also provision for generating the transaction receipts including the details of the sender, receiver,  amount and time. The senderâ€™s and receiverâ€™s account details get automatically updated after the transaction is done.

The website is also able to show the error messages if the transaction is not possible or due the false inputs given to the system.
